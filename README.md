# streetlightsnatureoverhaulchernarus for consoles!
Adds streetlights & nature reclaiming towns.
Both StreetLights & Nature's Overhaul are made by DonSibleyGames, 
I have just put them together.

Put the following code into the cfggameplay.json, over the existing code:

	"WorldsData":
	{
		"lightingConfig": 1,
		"objectSpawnersArr": ["/custom/strlightnaturekomarovo.json"],


  If you have more than 1 .json code, add a comma. Example -> , ["/custom/adminbase.json","/custom/bridge.json","/custom/bigteddybear.json"],
